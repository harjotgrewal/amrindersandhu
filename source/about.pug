                    p He designed his first website about Arnold Schwarzenegger (he’s still a fan) in 1999 using Microsoft FrontPage before focusing on his engineering. However, he kept playing with Photoshop while trying to learn C/C++ (he failed) during his bachelors 2003-07.

                    p It’s this very small village in Punjab, India where Amrinder was raised while learning family values and fundamentals of being a good human being. The tiny bit of creativity he has, he owes it to his mother, and like every child ever born, he is indebted to his parents for this life.

                    p A lot happened in those 8 years. He moved out to live in 4 different cities, managed to pass secondary school and finally graduation, appeared in various placement tests and finally got selected at Wipro (which he didn’t join), played soccer at inter-varsity level (big deal), came up 2nd in cross-country race (his first and last), played cricket and took a shot at weight-lifting and swimming (failed at both), met his wife, got engaged and finally got married.

                    p After dropping everything he learned (academically), he pursued a career in design. Starting full-time freelancing in Feb 2008, Amrinder has never looked back (at C++ or Wipro). He started designing and coding small websites for local clients and moved globally and worked with over a dozen of customers spanning 6 continents. From designing logos, visiting cards, letterheads, pamphlets, newsletters, decks to websites and applications, he got the opportunity to work on everything design from scratch while collaborating cross-functionally, improving and introducing processes, frameworks and tools.

                section.c-section__content
                    p While all of the above happened in his work and life, Amrinder managed to do a few side projects like designing and building a house for his family and a friend in India, interior decoration for his house in Canada, designing wedding card for himself, his wife, sister and a handful of cousins. Beyond designing digitally or otherwise, he loves DIYing. Recently, with his wife’s help, they remodled their master bathroom (thanks to YouTubers), and it was not easy.
