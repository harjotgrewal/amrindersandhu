            <p class="u-space_below--more">Discover is Unmetric’s third core product and #2 in usage/sales. I worked on it from ideation to execution with our CEO and Head of Product. The first discussion took place in October 2015 when our CEO briefed me his new idea. He explained that we have a huge amount of social data from six biggest networks, and it could be useful to look through that data and learn from history.</p>
    
            <h3>User Research</h3>

            <p class="u-space_below--more">Along with our product manager, I wrote a bunch of questions to understand user needs and challenges.

                <p>After our Head of Product shared a doc outlining product goals, specifications and MVP requirements, I got on a call with him to be on the same page. After digesting everything he shared, I recommended we should rather focus on the business outcomes (we are trying to achieve) and user outcomes (that we will help users achieve).</p> 


                <h3>Assumptions to be validated</h3>

                <p>In addition to that, I added assumptions we were making as a business and on behalf of users. We agreed that if these assumptions are proven to be false, our product might fail. We also listed down the least amount of features that can help our target audience to achieve their outcomes.</p>

            <h3>User needs and challenges</h3>

            <p>Using the user research data, I created a Google doc outlining user’s needs and challenges, efforts they were making, and their workflow. This helped build a shared understanding in the team. In the same doc we also wrote product vision and later on added the product architecture.</p>

            <h3>Experimenting the Amazon’s Way</h3>

            <p>Before adding the last section, i.e., Product architecture, I suggested our team to write a press release for Discover together. This approach is widely <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management" target="_link">used by Amazon</a> for developing new products and features. I wanted to experiment and the team agreed.</p>

            <p>Once we listed some exciting and interesting benefits of Discover for the target audience, I started thinking about the product architecture.</p>

            <p>I listed the most common actions (find, save, annotate, and share) users would need to perform in order to move forward in their workflow of content creation.</p>

            <p>Focusing on users’ needs helped me outline what type of content and features would help them achieve outcomes they seek.</p>

        <ul class="o-list--bullet l-span_4-10">
            <li><strong>Skipping the mockups</strong> can really speed things up. After sketching and creating prototypes, I had a fair idea on what’s required to be built. Since I was already handling the front-end for Analyze (Unmetric’s flagship product), it took me couple of days to setup the front-end foundation. After ten days of continuous coding, I delivered the first batch of UI components to our development team and kept working on lower priority stuff simultaneously.</li>

            <li><strong>Build to learn:</strong> I now believe we could have started with less and could have focused more on feedback. Instead, we went for a more complete solution (like Boards, Activity, etc.). The ability to search with filters could have been enough to learn and collect feedback, and we would have saved resources and shipped faster.</li>
