I’ve personally and closely worked with him on at least three SaaS products and have been pleasantly surprised each time. <b>I’d work with him in a heartbeat</b> — on anything related to design.

            <p><strong>As a design leader</strong>, I hired, mentored, and lead a team of five to explore, experiment, and contribute freely to the design process and tools.

I highly encourage my team to practice user empathy, cross-collaboration, focus on customer needs and business outcomes.</p>

            <p class="0u-pad_right--30"><strong>As an individual contributor</strong>, I built a dozen of products from ideation to execution.

While practicing user empathy, I continously encouraged our developers to think from user’s perespective as they build products and features.</p>
