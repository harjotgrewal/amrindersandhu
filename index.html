                <p><span>“</span>Forget design. Amrinder is the kind of person you want on your product team. Period. His thoughtful approach to designing great user experiences and products, unwillingness to accept intellectually lazy answers, and pursuit of beauty is refreshing and goes a long way towards building amazing products. I’ve personally and closely worked with him on at least three SaaS products and have been pleasantly surprised each time. I’d work with him in a heartbeat — on anything related to design. Heck, even if it wasn’t about design.<span>”</span></p>

        <h2 class="l-span_4">Experience</h2>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As a design leader</strong>, I hired, mentored, and lead a team of five to explore, experiment, and contribute freely to the design process and tools. I also conducted team retrospectives and feedback sessions with other teams. I highly encourage my team to practice user empathy, cross-collaboration, focus on customer needs and business outcomes.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As an individual contributor</strong>, I built a dozen of products from ideation to execution. With a user-centered approach, unwavering attention to details, and using data as a design tool, I continuously improved the quality and user experience of products while achieving business outcomes. I also built a design system and front-end architecture, designed websites, newsletters, and pitch decks. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As an inspiring team player</strong>, I introduced best practices, frameworks, and tools across the company to help improve processes, collaboration, and communication. I collaborated cross-functionally to optimize the conversion funnel, reduce churn and improve user experience. I also contributed to product and content strategy, user research, usability testing, and copywriting. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As a UX designer</strong>, I have put myself in customer’s shoes, asked questions to understand their goals and figure out jobs they are trying to perform. I participated in user interviews, shared best practices and books, and wrote interview questions. While practicing user empathy, I continously reminded and encouraged our developers to think from user’s perespective as they build products and features.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As a remote employee</strong> from day one, I have learned to overcome the biggest hurdles in a distant working relationship: communication and collaboration. I have worked with a dozen of clients on 50+ projects across timezones. Over the years, I have introduced tools and processes to help teams and individuals build an excellent working relationship without feeling isolated.</p>
