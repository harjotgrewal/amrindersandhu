                <p><span>“</span>Forget design. Amrinder is the <b>kind of person you want on your product team. Period.</b> His thoughtful approach to designing great user experiences and products, unwillingness to accept intellectually lazy answers, and <b>pursuit of beauty is refreshing</b> and goes a long way towards building amazing products. I’ve personally and closely worked with him on at least three SaaS products and have been pleasantly surprised each time. <b>I’d work with him in a heartbeat</b> — on anything related to design. Heck, even if it wasn’t about design.<span>”</span></p>

        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As a design leader</strong>, I hired, mentored, and lead a team of five to explore, experiment, and contribute freely to the design process and tools. I also conducted team retrospectives and feedback sessions with other teams. I highly encourage my team to practice user empathy, cross-collaboration, focus on customer needs and business outcomes.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p class="0u-pad_right--30"><strong>As an individual contributor</strong>, I built a dozen of products from ideation to execution. With a user-centered approach, unwavering attention to details, and using data as a design tool, I continuously improved the quality and user experience of products while achieving business outcomes. I also built a design system and front-end architecture, designed websites, newsletters, and pitch decks. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As a team player</strong>, I introduced best practices, frameworks, and tools across the company to help improve processes, collaboration, and communication. I collaborated cross-functionally to optimize the conversion funnel, reduce churn and improve user experience. I also contributed to product and content strategy, user research, usability testing, and copywriting. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As a UX designer</strong>, I have put myself in customer’s shoes, asked questions to understand their goals and figure out jobs they are trying to perform. I participated in user interviews, shared best practices and books, and wrote interview questions. While practicing user empathy, I continously encouraged our developers to think from user’s perespective as they build products and features.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4">
            <p><strong>As a remote employee</strong> from day one, I have learned to overcome the biggest hurdles in a distant working relationship: communication and collaboration. I have worked with a dozen of clients on 50+ projects across timezones. Over the years, I have introduced tools and processes to help teams and individuals build an excellent working relationship without feeling isolated.</p>
