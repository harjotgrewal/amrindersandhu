            <p>Research is at the core of everything I do, and it’s one of my favorite <a href="#design-tools">design tools</a>, along with empathy, data, and code. In design, I love problem-solving the most.</p>

            <p>From September 2013 to March 2020, I was the Head of Design at <a href="https://unmetric.com" target="_blank">Unmetric</a> (acquired by Cision). From day one, I designed all three core products &mdash; <a href="https://unmetric.com/analyze" target="_blank">Analyze</a>, <a href="https://unmetric.com/discover" target="_blank">Discover</a>, and <a href="https://unmetric.com/track" target="_blank">Track</a> &mdash; used by customers like Coca-Cola, Unilever, General Motors, and Accenture.</p>

        <div class="l-span_6-10 u-space_below">
            <p><strong>As an individual contributor</strong>, I built a dozen products from ideation to execution. With a user-centered approach, unwavering attention to details, and using data as a design tool, I continuously improved the quality and user experience of products while achieving business outcomes. I also built a design system and front-end architecture, designed websites, newsletters, and pitch decks. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4 u-space_below">
            <p><strong>As a UX designer</strong>, I have put myself in customer’s shoes, asked questions to understand their goals and figure out jobs they are trying to perform. I participated in user interviews, shared best practices and books, and wrote interview questions. While practicing user empathy, I contiunously encouraged our developers to think from the user’s perspective as they build products and features.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_6-10 u-space_below">
            <p><strong>As a team player</strong>, I introduced best practices, frameworks, and tools across the company to help improve processes, collaboration, and communication. I collaborated cross-functionally to optimize the conversion funnel, reduce churn and improve user experience. I also contributed to product and content strategy, user research, usability testing, and copywriting. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="l-span_4 u-space_below">
            <p><strong>As a design leader</strong>, I hired, mentored, and led a team of five to explore, experiment, and contribute freely to the design process and tools. I also conducted team retrospectives and feedback sessions with other teams. I highly encourage my team to practice user empathy, collaborate across functions, and focus on customer needs and business outcomes.</p>

        <div class="l-span_6-10">
            <p><strong>As a remote employee</strong> from day one, I have learned to overcome the biggest hurdles in a distant working relationship: communication and collaboration. I have worked with a dozen clients on 50+ projects across time zones. Over the years, I have introduced tools and processes to help teams and individuals build an excellent working relationship without feeling isolated.</p>
