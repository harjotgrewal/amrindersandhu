            <p>Currently, I’m the head of design at <a href="https://unmetric.com">Unmetric</a>, where I designed all the core products from scratch. While reinforcing design culture, a user-centered design vision, and UX principles, I also built the design system and front-end architecture.</p>
            
            <p>Besides leading design, I collaborated cross-functionally to build and maintain an efficient process for successful user onboarding, effective user research, and outcome-focused product development. In addition, I introduced tools, frameworks, and processes to increase productivity, align teams, and improve communication.</p>
            
            <p>For the past 12 years, I lead design at various early-stage startups working on everything from designing core products, websites, logos, pitch decks, and front-end. My clients include <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Zomato</strong>, <strong>Grasshopper</strong>, <strong>CIBC</strong>, <strong>MyEd</strong>, <strong>ProProfs</strong>, and <strong>PCL</strong><//strong>. I got job offers from <strong>Google</strong><//strong>, <strong>Groupon</strong>, and <strong>Intel</strong> that I couldn’t accept because of relocation.</p>

            <p>In 2007, I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I’m based in Ancaster, Canada, but grew up in a small village (Mishriwala) in Punjab, India.</p>

            <p>I love simplicity, nature, rain, mountains, walking, and <a href="journal.html">reading</a> <a href="books.html">design books</a>.</p>
