        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <div class="l-span_4-10">
            <h3>A village boy</h3>
            
            <p>I belong to a tiny village – Mishriwala in Punjab, India – where I was born and raised in a simple farming family. At a young age, I used to do fabric painting and draw brand logos to perfection. My creativity and curiosity comes from my mother.</p>


            <h3>Self-taught</h3>
            
            <p>In 2001, I designed my first website using Microsoft FrontPage. While getting started in design in 2007, I contacted a Yahoo designer who referred books and designers to learn from. I read more books in six months after college than during my whole school years.</p>


            <h3>Engineer turned designer</h3>
            
            <p>After completing my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, I started learning design on my own. Instead of joining Wipro technologies where I got placed during college, I opted for a freelance design career and never looked back.</p>  


            <h3>And then a unicorn</h3>

            <p>As a freelancer, I designed almost everything: apps, websites, blogs, logos, brochures, business cards, pitch decks, posters, calendars, ads, and stickers. Later, I built a design system, developed a front-end architecture, created style guides and onboarding videos.</p> 


            <h3>Google, Intel, Groupon</h3>
            
            <p>Before joining <a href="https://unmetric.com">Unmetric</a> full-time in 2013, I got job offers from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Groupon</strong>, <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Zomato</strong>, <strong>MakeMyTrip</strong>, <strong>BookMyShow</strong>, etc. which I couldn’t accept because of relocation. And I have no regrets.</p>


            <h3>Bedroom startup gets acquired</h3>
            
            <p>After leading design at <strong>PopSurvey</strong>, <strong>CitizenLocal</strong>, and <strong>Pixoto</strong> and doing projects with <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Zomato</strong>, and <strong>Grasshopper</strong>, I joined Unmetric full-time in 2013. Prior to that, I was working on contract basis with Unmetric from day one, when our CEO was operating from his house in Chennai.</p> 
                
            <p>From 2010 till 2020, I led the design at Unmetric, did hands-on work to design three core products, website, blog, collateral, front-end architecture, and design system. Cision/Falcon acquired Unmetric in October 2019.</p> 


            <h3>The story continues</h3>

            <p>There is so much more to learn and do. I’m blessed and I have so much to be grateful for. My goal in life is to learn, share, care, and become a better person than I was yesterday.</p>

        <h2 class="l-span_2">Interests</h2>

        <p class="l-span_4-10 u-space_below--more">Out of all the wonders of the mother nature, I’m most amazed by jellyfish and butterflies. My interests include walking, building DIY stuff, watching movies, playing cards with my kids, and <a href="journal.html">reading</a> <a href="library.html">design books</a>. I love simplicity, rain, mountains, and solitude. </p>
