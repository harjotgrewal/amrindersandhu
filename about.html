        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <div class="l-span_3-8">
            <h3>A village boy</h3>
            
            <p>I belong to a tiny village – Mishriwala in Punjab, India – where I was born and raised in a simple farming family. At a young age, I used to do fabric painting and draw brand logos to perfection. My creativity and curiosity comes from my mother.</p>

            <h3>Self-taught</h3>
            
            <p>In 2001, I designed my first website using Microsoft FrontPage. While getting started in design in 2007, I contacted a Yahoo designer who referred books and designers to learn from. I read more books in six months after college than during my whole school years.</p>

            <h3>Engineer turned designer</h3>
            
            <p>After completing my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, I started learning design on my own. Instead of joining Wipro technologies where I got placed during college, I opted for a freelance design career and never looked back.</p>  

            <h3>And then a unicorn</h3>

            <p>As a freelancer, I designed almost everything: apps, websites, blogs, logos, brochures, business cards, pitch decks, posters, calendars, ads, and stickers. Later, I built a design system, developed a front-end architecture, created style guides and onboarding videos.</p> 

            <h3>Side project (Relpost)</h3>
            
            <p>While doing gigs during the early days of my career, I also started a side project in 2011. I designed, coded, and curated <strong>Relpost</strong>, which featured five best posts on a vital design topic.</p>

            <h3>Google, Intel, Groupon</h3>
            
            <p>Before joining <a href="https://unmetric.com">Unmetric</a> full-time in 2013, I got job offers from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Groupon</strong>, <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Zomato</strong>, <strong>MakeMyTrip</strong>, <strong>BookMyShow</strong>, etc. which I couldn’t accept because of relocation. And I have no regrets.</p>

            <h3>Helping a bedroom startup get acquired</h3>
            
            <p>After leading design at various startups and doing projects with <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Zomato</strong>, and <strong>Grasshopper</strong>, I joined Unmetric full-time. Before that, I was already working with Unmetric on a contract basis from day one, when our CEO was operating from his house in Chennai.</p> 
                
            <p>From 2010 till 2020, I lead the design team, did hands-on work to design three core products, website, blog, collateral, front-end architecture, and design system. Falcon.io acquired Unmetric in October 2019.</p> 

            <h3>The story continues</h3>

            <p>I’m blessed and I have so much to be grateful for. My goal in life is to learn, share, care, and become a better person than I was yesterday.</p>
