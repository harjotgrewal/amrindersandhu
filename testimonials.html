Period.</b> His thoughtful approach to designing great user experiences and products, unwillingness to accept intellectually lazy answers, and <b>pursuit of beauty is refreshing</b> and goes a long way towards building amazing products. I’ve personally and closely worked with him on at least three SaaS products and have been pleasantly surprised each time. <b>I’d work with him in a heartbeat</b> — on anything related to design. Heck, even if it wasn’t about design.<span>”</span></p>

I’ve worked with Amrinder for almost a decade now and spent countless hours brainstorming, arguing and discussing ideas and concepts that eventually find their way into the products we developed. At Unmetric, <b>we received a lot of accolades for the design</b> and UI/UX and a lot of that credit should go to Amrinder. He is also a <b>capable leader</b> — he built up a great design team at Unmetric.
