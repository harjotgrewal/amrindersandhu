	title: 'Designing since 2003',
	copy: 'In 2003, I designed my first website (about Arnold Schwarzenegger) using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage">Microsoft FrontPage</a>. Before that I used to draw and paint brand logos to perfection. Later, I started playing with Photoshop to satisfy my curiosity and express my creativity. All these small exercises and experiments helped me later when I decided to start designing full-time in 2008.'

	title: 'Engineer turned Designer',
	copy: 'I did a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (2003-2007) before starting full-time freelancing in Feb, 2008. One thing that hasn’t changed during this transition from an Engineer to a Designer is his passion for understanding and solving problems. That Engineering side of his also helps him create a balance between making something that is usable and memorable, and aesthetically pleasing and delightful.'

	title: 'A Unicorn Designer',
	copy: 'As I’ve worked as a freelancer during the early years of my career (2008-2014), I got ample opportunities to design more than just apps. I have worked on branding, designed websites and blogs, pitching decks, marketing and product newsletters, brand value posters, social calendars, social media ads, sales collateral, ebooks and video covers, and logos for Unmetric and over a half dozen clients across the world. However, I love designing product experiences and interactions the most.'
