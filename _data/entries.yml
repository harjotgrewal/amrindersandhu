Hopefully, these can serve as inspirations for product teams to draft a meaningful story of success.',

For decades, some of the most successful products would be best described as simple,” says Lieb. “But simplicity comes in many dimensions: the number of buttons on an interface, number of features, steps in a flow or time it takes to complete a decision, and more.
