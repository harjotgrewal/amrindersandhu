	content: 'Forget design. Amrinder is the <b>kind of person you want on your product team. Period.</b> His thoughtful approach to designing great user experiences and products, unwillingness to accept intellectually lazy answers, and <b>pursuit of beauty is refreshing</b> and goes a long way towards building amazing products. I’ve personally and closely worked with him on at least three SaaS products and have been pleasantly surprised each time. <b>I’d work with him in a heartbeat</b> — on anything related to design. Heck, even if it wasn’t about design.'
