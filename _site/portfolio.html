                <h3>User Experience</h3>

                <p>A design leadership role is incomplete if it doesnâ€™t involve providing best possible user experience. In order to fulfil that, I collaborated with Customer success team who does weekly calls/email with customer, and get feature requests. I also listened to sale pitches across geographies to understand what solution our target audience is looking for and what jobs are they trying to perform. Apart from creating what customers are articulating loud, I also initiated a few dedicated projects just to improve the usability and user experience (QAS, DatePicker, Settings, Insights by Xia, Success checklist, Help menu, Help Center, Intercom messenger, etc.). With the help of our head of customer success, we kickstarted a handful of projects to improve user onboarding inside the platform.</p>

                <h3>User Research</h3>

                <p>It took me some time and effort to encourage our management team to seriously invest and focus on user research. I introduced JTBD, created a Slack channel to share JTBD ebooks, videos, interviews, and podcasts.  To conduct better quality research, I encouraged our team to read a couple of books and also shared notes on one of the books. My efforts were successful as our CEO assembled a team to conduct user interviews based on JTBD format and personally met various customers and interviewed them. I also built prototypes and MVPs to test waters on a couple of ideas. The results were not positive, but we did save a lot of engineering efforts by testing those MVPs and prototypes.</p>

                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>

                <p>To make sure design is serving its purpose of helping users solve their problem and make progress in their jobs, it must be usable before beautiful. I helped conduct multiple usability tests with our user research team, both with customers and our teammates. I even wrote a field guide with how-tos and best practices. For test usability some of the features where we were not 100% confident, I helped team write test cases so we can get quality feedback. Later on, after seeing the benefits, our PMs started doing it on their own.</p>

                <h3>Team Alignment and Collaboration</h3>

                <p>Managing and working with remote teams is difficult. Being a remote designer from day 1, I have a good amount of experience on things that can go sideways and how to manage and fix them. To improve collaboration at Unmetric, I started Skype groups, introduced Trello, Invision and later on Slack. To understand and manage business goals, I sold OKRs to our CEO and created a Google Sheets template to help everyone get up to speed. Kickoffs, release checklists, steering slides, and monthly retrospectives were other significant things that I implemented to help improve alignment and collaboration.</p>

                <h3>Front-end Development</h3>

                <p>I belong to the designers-who-can-code camp. With over a decade of experience in front-end development, I have been hand-coding since the days of Internet Explorer 6, and when PSD to HTML conversions was a thing. Over the years, I have written HTML/CSS for everything from websites, newsletters to full-fledged web applications. At Unmetric, I introduced Gulp, Sass, Jade, and built CSS architecture using concepts like OOCSS, SMACSS, BEM, and libraries like Compass and Bourbon. My responsibilities included overseeing the front-end development and mentoring two of the front-end developers. I also pitched the adoption of Angular to our engineering team in 2016, which didnâ€™t happen as switching from GWT to Angular would take months.</p>

                <h3>Design System</h3>

                <p>When Atomic design became a thing, I was working on the first redesign of Unmetric Analyze (2013). I took screenshots of the whole app and started compiling the repetitive UI components. I began with the foundation (typography, grid, colors), then came buttons, forms, and tabs. As we started developing more products, we used Frontify as a central place for all the existing UI components, voice and tone guide, brand assets, color codes, etc. Using a third-party brand management platform helped us create the foundation of our design system without devoting a lot of resources. Later, as the team grew, we built the UNDS (Unmetric design system). To strengthen our brand, we also created brand guidelines and templates for Google Docs, Slides, and Keynote for sales and marketing.</p>

                <h3>Product Strategy</h3>

                <p>Being a part of a product company, I contributed and influenced the product strategy on various occasions. We clearly defined our target audience (big brand and agencies) and also distinguished between choosers and users so we can cater to their needs better. I helped test a few ideas before we decided to commit more resources. By advocating and making customer research an integral part of our product strategy, I helped our team discover the needs of our customers and find a product-market fit. I also led the design team on one of the use-case groups and helped research and write better job stories.</p>

                <h3>Content Strategy</h3>

                <p>Along with designing the website and blog, I closely worked with our marketing team to test different content approaches. We tried showcasing product benefits instead of features, replaced product pages with solutions, and added Why Unmetric section that focuses on jobs that our customers perform and how Unmetric can help them do those jobs in a better way.</p>
