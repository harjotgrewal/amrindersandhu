          <h3>Designing since 2003</h3>
          <p>Amrinder designed his first website (about Arnold Schwarzenegger) in 2003 using Microsoft FrontPage. Before that he used to draw and paint brand logos to perfection. Later, Amrinder started playing with Photoshop to satisfy his curiosity and express his creativity. All these small exercises and experiments helped him later when he decided to start designing full time in 2008. </p>

          <h3>Engineer turned Designer</h3>
          <p>Amrinder did a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (2003-2007) before starting full-time freelancing in Feb, 2008. One thing that hasn’t changed during this transition from an Engineer to a Designer is his passion for understanding and solving problems. That Engineering side of his also helps him create a balance between making something that is usable and memorable, and aesthetically pleasing and delightful.</p>

          <h3>Google, Intel, Groupon</h3>
          <p>Before joining Unmetric full-time in 2014, I have lead design at various startups. I’ve worked with <strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Zomato</strong>, <strong>Grasshopper</strong>, <strong>CIBC</strong>, and <strong>Raja Sandhu</strong> over the years. I also got job offers from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Groupon</strong>, and <strong>Intel</strong> which I couldn’t accept because of relocation.</p>

          <h3>A Unicorn Designer</h3>
          <p>Since Amrinder worked as a freelancer during the early years of his career (2008-2014), he got opportunities to design more than just websites and applications. He has worked on branding, designed websites and blogs, pitching decks, marketing and product newsletters, brand value posters, social calendars, social media ads, sales collateral, ebooks and video covers, and logos for Unmetric and over a half dozen clients across the world. However, he loves designing product experiences and interactions the most.</p>
