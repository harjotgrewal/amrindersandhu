            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5">“What works for our remote team are things that work for all humans — trust, transparency, clear communication, clear expectations, mutual respect, accountability and camaraderie,” Leung says. “When it comes to remote work, there’s no huge secret or magic potion. To make our large remote team work, we do a lot of small things consistently and we know that every element matters. It’s like going to the gym every day — everyone knows it’s healthy, but not everyone does it consistently. We also know we’re not perfect, that we’ll screw things up along the way, that we’ll fall short. That’s okay. We know what our North Star is, and we all have a chance to do better every day,” Leung says.</div>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>While Airbnb is data driven, they don’t let data push them around. Instead of developing reactively to metrics, the team often starts with a creative hypothesis, implements a change, reviews how it impacts the business and then repeats that process. <br/> <br/>Individual team members at Airbnb make small bets on new features, and then measure if there’s a meaningful return on the bet. If there’s a payoff, they send more pirates in that direction. This structure encourages employees to take measured, productive risks on behalf of the company that can lead to the development of major new features. It allows Airbnb to move quickly and continually find new opportunities.</p></div>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>For so many managers and leaders — especially those of us who are used to be the person doing the work and are now handing off the work to others — learning to delegate is, well, tricky, if not painful. The good news is that we are by no means alone. I recently happened upon some helpful advice from leaders who similarly have a tough time delegating in a few conversations on The Watercooler. And they were incredibly generous with their advice.</p></div>

As the company starts to grow, it may make sense to do team level OKRs. But those teams should not be functional teams, they should be product or mission teams. Don’t create engineering OKRs, product team OKRs, and marketing team OKRs. That doesn’t make sense.</p></div>

            </a>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">User flows are vital to design great UX. It helps detect edge cases so one can address them effectively.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>User flows are visual representations of the path the user can follow to achieve a goal while using an app, website or any other product. Creating a representation like this, helps designers reflect on the flow themselves, communicate it with the team and stakeholders and get feedback. User flows also allow designers to compare alternatives, as well as evaluate and test them with real users before proceeding. The better designed the user flows, the easier it is for the audience to understand the story behind the designs and therefore the more constructive the feedback they will give.</p></div>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">When I review copy, I encourage brevity but not at the expense of clarity or personality.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>UX copy is dependent on so much outside your control. The subject of the content itself, the position of a page in the user flow, and your users’ wants and needs. We often strangle ourselves into writing short copy no matter what. Not only can this hinder sales, it chokes any life or tone out of your copy. There is such a thing as being too brief—it kills personality.</p></div>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5">Object mapping, my process behind OOUX, is content modeling for designers who do not deal with content in the traditional sense, but still need to design systems—and not just systems of implementation. While a tight collection of reusable templates and modules is invaluable, those design patterns don’t hold meaning for a user unless they’re backed by a system of real-world objects that matches that user’s mental model. Focus first on designing the system of real-world objects, then on designing a system of implementation to bring it all to life. This is the linchpin of all my design work, because it transforms goals into an executable system that meets those goals.</div>

            </a>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">Asking the right question helps in finding the answer easily.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5">Musk says he finds inspiration in the shower, in the middle of the night, and out with friends. Pretty normal, right? It’s what he does after that which makes all the difference. You can use the same approach. Asking the right questions is a skill that can be learned, according to Warren Berger, bestselling author of A More Beautiful Question.</div>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">How reducing cognitive load can help with user adoption and virality.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5">Technology aside, at the core of Bump’s success was the simple act of touching two phones together. It was straightforward and repeatable — even executed without explanation. “Yes, it’s true that simplicity in products is not a new idea. For decades, some of the most successful products would be best described as simple,” says Lieb. “But simplicity comes in many dimensions: the number of buttons on an interface, number of features, steps in a flow or time it takes to complete a decision, and more. But the dimension that matters most is cognitive simplicity: how easy your product is to understand.”</div>

            </a>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">When it comes to user interface design, clarity is job #1.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5">Clarity is the first and most important job of any interface. To be effective using an interface you’ve designed, people must be able to recognize what it is, care about why they would use it, understand what the interface is helping them interact with, predict what will happen when they use it, and then successfully interact with it. While there is room for mystery and delayed gratification in interfaces, there is no room for confusion. Clarity inspires confidence and leads to further use. One hundred clear screens is preferable to a single cluttered one.</div>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">Great article about Thinking, Listening and Imagination.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>We avoid the pain of thinking like a medical examination. We’d like to believe we’re too smart to think. Thinking is stressful. While stereotypes click together sweetly, thinking comes in bitter flavors. We recur to clichés rather than reflection, because they make us wise without listening, bright without reasoning, and smart without taking the risk of being imprecise, boring, annoying, wrong. And just like McFood they’re easily bought and quickly swallowed, zero intellectual calories. Just as instinctively as we avoid listening, reflecting, and using our imagination to achieve clarity in writing, we avoid thought when we design websites.</p></div>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">Design is about solving problems. So, listen before you start.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>If you spend time observing and talking with people who use your product or service, fantastic creative ideas start to appear. Also, features you once thought were critical become irrelevant as your audience tells you what their true emotions are behind the decisions they make. None of this happens in front of a whiteboard in the comfort of your office.</p></div>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>When designing a full set of headlines like this, it’s a great idea to start with the smallest headline and work your way up like we did today. While you’re at it, make sure you design how bolds and italics look in a paragraph, as well as lists, blockquotes, and all the common styles that will show up in a page. We call this a “General Styles” page. You can include tables, images, captions, and even form elements. Planning ahead for the styles you might need in the future helps you build a more complete typographic system and avoid any surprises.</p></div>
