            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_4-10">By reading a couple of books, an article on Medium, and talking to a few people at Amazon, I learned that the leadership principles are the mind and soul of how things get down at Amazon. These 14 leadership principles are shared across the biggest startup where each team and individual have the freedom to choose and follow their path to deliver results.<br/><br/> <a href="https://medium.com/@anaami/how-i-sort-of-applied-amazons-leadership-principles-in-my-previous-job-ee40cb3b1aff" target="_blank">Read my article on Medium &rarr;</a></div>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_4-10">I approve of the spirit behind the introduction of empathy into design, but I believe the concept is impossible, and even if possible, wrong. The reason we often talk about empathy in design is that we really need to understand the people that we’re working for. The idea is that, essentially, you’re in a person’s head and understand how they feel and what they think.</div>

Because we don’t realize we have a bad habit, a shortcoming, or we are missing something. <br/><br/> <a href="https://medium.com/@anaami/how-i-make-time-and-you-can-too-6cf83265d9b" target="_blank">Read my article on Medium &rarr;</a></div>

In the following, I put together 10 frameworks about metric settings that I’ve seen being used or discussed in the industry. I’ll start with the popular business-oriented metrics, moving on to experience-oriented ones, and end with the lesser-known-yet-important social impact metrics. Hopefully, these can serve as inspirations for product teams to draft a meaningful story of success.</div>

To make our large remote team work, we do a lot of small things consistently and we know that every element matters. It’s like going to the gym every day — everyone knows it’s healthy, but not everyone does it consistently. We also know we’re not perfect, that we’ll screw things up along the way, that we’ll fall short. That’s okay. We know what our North Star is, and we all have a chance to do better every day,” Leung says.</p></div>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_4-10"><p>While Airbnb is data driven, they don’t let data push them around. Instead of developing reactively to metrics, the team often starts with a creative hypothesis, implements a change, reviews how it impacts the business and then repeats that process. <br/> <br/>Individual team members at Airbnb make small bets on new features, and then measure if there’s a meaningful return on the bet. If there’s a payoff, they send more pirates in that direction. This structure encourages employees to take measured, productive risks on behalf of the company that can lead to the development of major new features. It allows Airbnb to move quickly and continually find new opportunities.</p></div>

Consider showing your most important values with bars, position (like in a dot plot) or even areas, and to use colors to only show categories.

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_4-10"><p>User flows are visual representations of the path the user can follow to achieve a goal while using an app, website or any other product. Creating a representation like this, helps designers reflect on the flow themselves, communicate it with the team and stakeholders and get feedback. User flows also allow designers to compare alternatives, as well as evaluate and test them with real users before proceeding. The better designed the user flows, the easier it is for the audience to understand the story behind the designs and therefore the more constructive the feedback they will give.</p></div>

The subject of the content itself, the position of a page in the user flow, and your users’ wants and needs. We often strangle ourselves into writing short copy no matter what. Not only can this hinder sales, it chokes any life or tone out of your copy. There is such a thing as being too brief—it kills personality.</p></div>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_4-10">Object mapping, my process behind OOUX, is content modeling for designers who do not deal with content in the traditional sense, but still need to design systems—and not just systems of implementation. While a tight collection of reusable templates and modules is invaluable, those design patterns don’t hold meaning for a user unless they’re backed by a system of real-world objects that matches that user’s mental model. Focus first on designing the system of real-world objects, then on designing a system of implementation to bring it all to life. This is the linchpin of all my design work, because it transforms goals into an executable system that meets those goals.</div>

Your Critical User Journey should focus on a single use case with a specific goal and include the surrounding context for the user. For example, one of the journeys that Pinterest is focused on is helping a user find ideas around their own personal style. A Pinterest user typically starts from browsing a large visual catalog of style ideas, and then progresses to discovering the right looks that fit their own style.</div>

Activity modeling, part of the well-established usage-centered design method, is a simple and systematic way to capture and organize understanding about human activity as it relates to the design of applications and other technology tools.

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_4-10">Clarity is the first and most important job of any interface. To be effective using an interface you’ve designed, people must be able to recognize what it is, care about why they would use it, understand what the interface is helping them interact with, predict what will happen when they use it, and then successfully interact with it. While there is room for mystery and delayed gratification in interfaces, there is no room for confusion. Clarity inspires confidence and leads to further use. One hundred clear screens is preferable to a single cluttered one.</div>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30"><span class="c-dropcap">G</span>reat advice on setting type for headings.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_6"><p>When designing a full set of headlines like this, it’s a great idea to start with the smallest headline and work your way up like we did today. While you’re at it, make sure you design how bolds and italics look in a paragraph, as well as lists, blockquotes, and all the common styles that will show up in a page. We call this a “General Styles” page. You can include tables, images, captions, and even form elements. Planning ahead for the styles you might need in the future helps you build a more complete typographic system and avoid any surprises.</p></div>
