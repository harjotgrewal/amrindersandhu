            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>While Airbnb is data driven, they don’t let data push them around. Instead of developing reactively to metrics, the team often starts with a creative hypothesis, implements a change, reviews how it impacts the business and then repeats that process. <br/> <br/>Individual team members at Airbnb make small bets on new features, and then measure if there’s a meaningful return on the bet. If there’s a payoff, they send more pirates in that direction. This structure encourages employees to take measured, productive risks on behalf of the company that can lead to the development of major new features. It allows Airbnb to move quickly and continually find new opportunities.</p></div>

Consider showing your most important values with bars, position (like in a dot plot) or even areas, and to use colors to only show categories.

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>For so many managers and leaders — especially those of us who are used to be the person doing the work and are now handing off the work to others — learning to delegate is, well, tricky, if not painful. The good news is that we are by no means alone. I recently happened upon some helpful advice from leaders who similarly have a tough time delegating in a few conversations on The Watercooler. And they were incredibly generous with their advice.</p></div>

As the company starts to grow, it may make sense to do team level OKRs. But those teams should not be functional teams, they should be product or mission teams. Don’t create engineering OKRs, product team OKRs, and marketing team OKRs. That doesn’t make sense.</p></div>

            </a>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">User flows are vital to design great UX. It helps detect edge cases so one can address them effectively.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>User flows are visual representations of the path the user can follow to achieve a goal while using an app, website or any other product. Creating a representation like this, helps designers reflect on the flow themselves, communicate it with the team and stakeholders and get feedback. User flows also allow designers to compare alternatives, as well as evaluate and test them with real users before proceeding. The better designed the user flows, the easier it is for the audience to understand the story behind the designs and therefore the more constructive the feedback they will give.</p></div>

            <p class="c-entry__comment l-span_2 u-pad_right--30">When I review copy, I encourage brevity but not at the expense of clarity or personality.</p>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>UX copy is dependent on so much outside your control. The subject of the content itself, the position of a page in the user flow, and your users’ wants and needs. We often strangle ourselves into writing short copy no matter what. Not only can this hinder sales, it chokes any life or tone out of your copy. There is such a thing as being too brief—it kills personality.</p></div>

            <div class="c-entry__blurb l-span_5"><p>We avoid the pain of thinking like a medical examination. We’d like to believe we’re too smart to think. Thinking is stressful. While stereotypes click together sweetly, thinking comes in bitter flavors. We recur to clichés rather than reflection, because they make us wise without listening, bright without reasoning, and smart without taking the risk of being imprecise, boring, annoying, wrong. And just like McFood they’re easily bought and quickly swallowed, zero intellectual calories. Just as instinctively as we avoid listening, reflecting, and using our imagination to achieve clarity in writing, we avoid thought when we design websites.</p></div>

We call this a “General Styles” page. You can include tables, images, captions, and even form elements.
