        <p class="l-span_3-9 u-space_below--more">In Analyze date-picker, we intentionally didn’t allow entering the start and end dates, believing it will prevent users from making errors. But users were facing issues because of our choice, so I decided to fix it. Apart from offering the editable date inputs, we also provided better ways of selecting dates and months faster.</p>

        <p class="l-span_3-9">In this project, I worked closely with one of our front-end developers, two backend developers, and a dev lead. Here’s exactly what I did:</p>

    <!-- PROBLEM SECTION -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="l-span_2">Problem</h2>


        <div class="l-span_6">
            <p>Our senior account manager pinged me for the second time, “Can we fix the date-picker?”. I have been postponing it for a few months as the existing date-picker was working fine, but there was definitely room for improvement. (Is there anything, expect things not designed by humans, where this is not the case?) Here’s what she wrote:</p> 
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Amrinder, I’m having a huge problem with the date picker and the “custom” time period. Having to click through the months when I want to do a whole year or more is too many clicks. Also, when using the picker, having the start date same and changing the end date is near impossible. Any chance we can go back to the old way where we could manually input year if we needed?”</p>
                <footer>&mdash; Our account manager on Slack </footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I promised to look into it the following week and keep her posted.</p>

        <div class="l-span_6">
            <h3>What’s wrong with the existing date-picker</h3>

            <p class="l-span_4">The existing date-picker doesn’t allow you to input dates. One can only click to select a date range. We have 1-click selections for the last seven days, last week, last month, and last 30 days. However, to select any particular month or other periods, such as the last two quarters and one or more years, users have to click on the calendar’s previous/next navigation buttons multiple times. It was a simple and error-free way of selecting a date range.</p>

            
        </div>

            <figcaption class="l-span_2">The old date-picker with two separate start and end date calendars. It allowed only click-based selections. Users had to click multiple times, but it was an intuitive and error-free solution.</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p class="l-span_3-9">This was not a feature request; it didn’t come from the R&D team or our CEO or sales or marketing. This came from one of our account managers. To verify this, I reached out to a few other Account Managers and asked if they received any comments/feedback on the date-picker.</p>

                <h3>Let’s study the usage data</h3>

                <p>After they confirmed, I decided to look at the usage data. One of our front-end developers, who mostly worked with me, agreed to participate in the research. She reached out to one of our developers and collected date-picker usage data for the last eight months.</p> 

                <p>We posted our research on Slack to encourage others. This was a prime example showcasing how data can help learn more about the problem and assist in designing a better solution. </p>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>

            <p>Using these insights, we decided to break the date-picker in three sections:</p>

            <ol class="o-list--ordered">
                <li>A drop-down with a list of most frequently used options.</li>

                <li>An extended drop-down, where the first section is editable date inputs.</li>

                <li>Second section with the ability to quickly select months, quarters, and years.</li>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>

            <p>I shared these sketches with our dev lead for getting his input on the efforts and time it would take to build. He suggested we break it down into two releases as the second tab was a unique UI, something the JS library they were exploring didn’t support.</p>
