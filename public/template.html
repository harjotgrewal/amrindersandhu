        <p class="c-section__blurb">It was not always like this, Amrinder had a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering before he moved on to become a designer. However, his core area of interest has not changed during this move: solving problems. </p>
        <p class="c-section__blurb">He designed his first website featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger (he&apos;s still a fan) in 1999 using Microsoft FrontPage before focusing on his engineering. However, he kept playing with Photoshop while trying to learn C/C++ (he failed) during his bachelors 2003-07. </p>

        <p class="c-section__aside">1983-1999</p>
        <p class="c-section__blurb">It&apos;s this very small village in Punjab, India where Amrinder was raised while learning family values and fundamentals of being a good human being. The tiny bit of creativity he has, he owes it to his mother, and like every child ever born, he is indebted to his parents for this life.           </p>
        <p class="c-section__aside">2000-2008</p>
        <p class="c-section__blurb">A lot happened in those 8 years. He moved out to live in 4 different cities, managed to pass secondary school and finally graduation, appeared in various placement tests and finally got selected at Wipro (which he didnâ€™t join), played soccer at inter-varsity level (big deal), came up 2nd in cross-country race (his first and last), played cricket and took a shot at weight-lifting and swimming (failed at both), met his wife, got engaged and finally got married.</p>
