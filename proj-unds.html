            <p>Design systems are usually created in larger teams to have a single source of truth that allows for a scalable UI and visual language. However, at Unmetric, we hired our first product designer in 2018, and before that, I was the only designer doing hands-on design work on products, website, and everything else. So, it was just me, and I knew almost everything in my head. </p>

        <h3 class="l-span_3-9">Why build a design system for only one designer?</h3>

        <p class="l-span_3-9">I didn’t fancy having a design system because the big guys and a few others were having one. For me it was about: </p>


        <ol class="o-list--ordered l-span_3-9">
            <li><strong>Reducing my workload:</strong> For every small addition, I had to write the front-end code to convey how the UI will work on look. With UI components, I could simply sketch the UI and point the developers to the right component.</li>

            <li><strong>Speeding up the UI development:</strong> Even if I had to do it, I could quickly copy-paste the UI code from a dedicated place and share it with developers.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Reduce UI issues:</strong> Once I hand off the UI, there were still a handful of UI bugs reported during the testing. I wanted a place where QA team members can go and find a fix.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Providing brand assets to marketing:</strong> Every once in a while, someone would ask me where are our logo is and if there are any usage guidelines.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3 class="l-span_3-9">5 years in the making</h3>

            <figcaption class="l-span_full">Screenprints of Unmetric Analyze in 2013.</figcaption>

        <div class="l-span_3-9 l-grid_of_6">
            <p class="l-span_full">My first attempt at building a UI components library was in 2013 when atomic design just came out. I had just joined Unmetric full-time and started with making the platform consistent. I conducted a visual audit by printed all the existing screens, put them on the wall, and marked the common elements. This was our first significant product redesign in 3 years.</p>

            <p class="l-span_full">Instead of building a complete design system that would take months and a lot of resources (which we didn’t have), I hosted our brand guidelines and UI library at Frontify. This allowed marketing to have direct access to our brand assets. I also worked with our copywriter to add Voice and Tone guide.</p>

            <figcaption class="l-span_2">UNDS was first hosted at Frontify. It helped us lay the groundwork without investing too many resources.</figcaption>

        <p class="l-span_3-9">After we hired two front-end developers and a senior product designer, we were able to add more comprehensive documentation around our product and brand guidelines. </p>

            </figure>
        </div>


        <p class="l-span_3-9">I handed over the design system management to our senior product designer to spare myself to focus more on strategic and operational responsibilities. To expand our design system in the whole company, we also held a meeting with our engineering team, head of product, and head of engineering. We showed them what we have build and our plan to add GWT patterns to it so we can speed up the development while reducing the amount of UI issues.</p>

        <p class="l-span_3-9">Unmetric got acquired in 2019 while we are expanding and building UNDS. At that point, we only had UI components library and brand guidelines, but we still called it a design system as that was our North Star. </p>
